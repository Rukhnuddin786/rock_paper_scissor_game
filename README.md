🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game (Python)
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Python where you play against the computer.

🎮 How It Works:
When you run the program, you'll be greeted with a welcome message.

You'll be asked to choose between:

0 for Rock

1 for Paper

2 for Scissors

The computer then randomly makes its choice.

Both choices are displayed using fun ASCII art.

The game logic compares the user's input with the computer's and displays who won, lost, or if it was a draw.

🧠 Game Logic:
Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

Same choices = Draw
